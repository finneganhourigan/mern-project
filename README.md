Filtering Discs

    - Create a button to reset all filters
    	○ Flight numbers to inactive
    	○ Checkboxes to unchecked

    - Currently:
    	○ Reset button resets state, but checkboxes and sliders, remain the same
    	○ Sort order is not done automatically, user must apply filters
    		§ Idea: Use useEffect upon the change of sortOrder???
